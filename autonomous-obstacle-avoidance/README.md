# Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for an autonomous system designed to navigate and avoid obstacles. The project aims to leverage various sensors and algorithms to achieve real-time obstacle detection and avoidance in robotic systems.


## Features

- Real-time obstacle detection using LiDR sensor.
- Advanced path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms.

### Usage

To run the obstacle avoidance system, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Ensure that all hardware components are connected and properly configured before running the system.
